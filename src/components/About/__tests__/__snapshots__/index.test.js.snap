      </h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Olivia Elliott and I am a novice Full Stack Developer. I recently graduated from the 24 week UNC Chapel Hill Full Stack Development program in September of 2022. In this intensive class, I have learned many skills and aspire to continue my research and growth in my future career and in side projects of my own. I have always had a desire to be able to find a career that will offer me the ability to continue to grow and learn and I have found that place in the tech community. I am so excited to strengthen my skills as a developer and contribute to this community of intellectual and like minded individuals.
